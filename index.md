I'm a Mechanincal Engineering student at the [Univerisity of Washington Tacoma](https://www.tacoma.uw.edu/set/programs/undergrad/me). I recieved my Associate's in Science from Pierce College with a focus on Mechanical Engineering in 2021.

Engineering is my passion and hope to one day to become a PE in a field where creativity and knowlegde in engineering principles are sought. I look forward to new challenges and methods in improving my abilities, skills and character.

Many new projects are in the works to be done over this next school year and hope to update you on the progress here on this website.
