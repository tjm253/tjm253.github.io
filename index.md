I'm Tayber McMullen and a Mechanical Engineering student at the [Univerisity of Washington Tacoma](https://www.tacoma.uw.edu/set/programs/undergrad/me). I recieved my Associate's in Science from Pierce College with a focus in Mechanical Engineering in 2021.

I am passionate about physics, math, creative pursuits, nature and technology. I snowboard and do many other activities when I am not studying for my next exam. I look forward to challenges where others be daunted. This website that I created here provides a great way to present my projects, my experience, and my plans for the future. At the bottom you can find links to my LinkedIn, Email and GitHub.
