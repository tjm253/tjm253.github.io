I'm Tayber McMullen and a Mechanical Engineering student at the [Univerisity of Washington Tacoma](https://www.tacoma.uw.edu/set/programs/undergrad/me). I recieved my Associate's in Science from Pierce College with a focus in Mechanical Engineering in 2021.

I am passionate about physics, math, creative pursuits, nature and technology. I like to snowboard, hike in the Pacific Northwest, tutor, and to learn neat facts about anything. I look forward to challenges where others may be daunted. This website presents my projects, my experiences, and my plans for the future. At the bottom you can find links to my LinkedIn, Email and GitHub. Bookmark this website so you can follow my journey. ❤️
