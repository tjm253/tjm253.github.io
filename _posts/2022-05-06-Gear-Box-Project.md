## Role

Calculations gear design and force analysis

## Overview

This project was to create a 20:1 gearbox for a theoretical scooter company. The gearbox must be valuable to the customer.
## Design Process

We were given the input torque and speed and the desired gear ratio of the gear box. The explicit constraints were not given such as the safety factors were not given and were to be inferred. The objective was to create a relatively small gearbox so that the weight and the size does not impede the use of the scooter. We wanted to have low resistance from friction. To allow for safe operation of the scooter, our team decided to have a 95% reliability factor and a factor of safety of 1.5. Using one of the standard gear steels, S45C steel, we found a safe, reliable, economical, and compact design. The final overall design can be found here [20:1 gearbox](/GearBox_PG-1.pdf). 

## Presentation

After having a working design, our team presented each component of the gearbox. The gearbox was presented with a 3D printed design which could theoretically be made using industrial materials. I presented the force analysis and gear sizing calculations. Our presentation was scored both by the attending professors and by our peers. We were graded on communication of necessary specifics of our design, answering questions and our overall design. 

## Final Model

Our final gearbox was able to withstand high amounts of torque and speed. Using a drill motor, we stressed tested the gearbox. The gearbox withstood the testing and is donated to eventually be displayed at UW Tacoma in the ME department.
