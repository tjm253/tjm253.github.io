## Overview

This group project was done under the direction of Dr. Hee-Seok Kim with Qier A, Pavel N, Ryan S, and Tayber M (myself).

We were tasked with creating a [20:1 gearbox](/GearBox_PG-1.pdf) made for a scooter with given specifications. We developed a gearbox design which could be applied to a design for an electric scooter. I was tasked with the [gear tooth calculations](/Summary_Calculations_Parts_Meeting-Record.docx.pdf) where we assumed that the gears were made of steel with good performance, cost and weight characteristics.
