## Overview

This project is to develop my skills in Python by solving problem from [Project Euler.com](https://projecteuler.net/archives). All files can be found on my [github repository](https://github.com/tjm253/projecteuler).

## Project Summary

Before completing this project, I have had little experience in Python before finishing this project. [Project Euler.com](https://projecteuler.net/archives) has many problems which could not be done with a brute force calculation. Many problems called for ingenious solutions. If not optimized properly, the programs would either exceed the limit of present memory or would continue running for months. After some dedication, I was able to build my skills to solve these problems.

From text resources, I incorporated comments and a clear format to allow anyone (mostly myself) to refer back to the code.
