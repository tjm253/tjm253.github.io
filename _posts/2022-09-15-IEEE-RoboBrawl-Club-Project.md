## Overview

IEEE Club combines the efforts of engineering students from multiple disciplines to build a functioning machine. This school year, we are creating a 30 lb. radio-controlled robot which will compete in a competitive fight with other robots from other schools, clubs and hobbyists. Our robot will wield a weapon which will be used on the other robots. EE, ME, CE, CS, math, and other STEM students will work together to create a robot which will compete in 2023.

## Role

Officer: Elected and assigned to collaborate and lead with other elected representatives to serve the club and its members. The club has more than 100 members with around 30 being active members.

## Status
Voted to participate in the RoboBrawl Competition with a ranked voting system on 10/31/22. As officer, I will be working with other lead members to create infrastructure to allow for collaborative design with maximized efficiency.
