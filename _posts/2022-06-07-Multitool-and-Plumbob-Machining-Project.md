## Overview

This machining project focuses on machining, heat treating, and precision measurement to validate machining quality. The metal used was tool grade steel and 4 parts where used to complete the multitool. The other project was to complete a functional Plum Bob.

# Multitool Project

## Manufacturing

In our machining class, we were given dimensions for the designed multitool. All parts of the multitool were completed using a horizontal mill. Using our machining textbook, we calculated the feed rate and milling speed as if we were using a CNC machine. The milling of the components of the multitool was much easier knowing machining theory such as chip size, heat dissipation, and bit wear. Understanding the trade-offs between wear and tear of the bit and time using mill, is essential in a manufacturing environment. The multitool was milled according to specs given and mostly within desired tolerances using GD&T.

## Heat Treating

The steel was elevated to its to its precipitation temperature to allow the steel to age harden. This heat treatment process allows the metal to relieve internal stress from machining within its metallic structure. The metal was wrapped in aluminum foil to impede air infiltration during heating which causes carbon to build on the surface of the metal.

## Measure for Tolerances
Following heat treatment and scrubbing off carbon build-up, precision measurement was used to find the dimensions of the completed multitool. Measuring the final results, gave me the opportunity to see if my part was within the desired tolerances. The drawings, the complete description of the manufacturing process, measurement of final product, and evaluation of tolerances can be found in this [final design report PDF](/multitool-TayberMcMullen-TME345.pdf). This report also contains the outcome for a plumb bob which I also created.

# Blumb Bob Project

This project was focused on using an industrial lathe to construct a functional plum bob. The details for the construction and evaluation for the plum bob project can be found in the same [final design report PDF](/multitool-TayberMcMullen-TME345.pdf).
