## Overview

This project is to develop my skills in Python by solving problem from [Project Euler.com](https://projecteuler.net/archives). All files can be found on my [github repository](https://github.com/tjm253/projecteuler). Python is an excellent high-level programming language which can be used in many applications. Being free, open-source and with an abundance of free packages, Python allows me to accomplish mathematical operations without being in a curated but constrictive programming environment.

## Project Summary

Before completing this project, I have had little experience in Python, but I have now gain proficient abilities to solve complex math operations using Python. This project allowed me to understand the operating limits of computing. Many problems which [Project Euler.com](https://projecteuler.net/archives) had posed dealt with complex problems which could not be done with a brute force solution. If not optimized with novel solutions, the programs would either exceed the limit of present memory or would continue running for months. After some time, I would develop an efficient and understandable to the problem.

From text resources, I incorporated the convections from PEP 8 which advise how to create readable and efficient code—or to create so-called “Pythonic code.” Using those convections, my code is filled with adequate comments to allow any layman to follow my code with relative ease.
